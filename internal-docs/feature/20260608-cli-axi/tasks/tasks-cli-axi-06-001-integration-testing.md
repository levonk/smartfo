## Summary

Implement comprehensive integration testing for all agent mode features. Test mode selection, TOON format, minimal schemas, content truncation, pre-computed aggregates, empty states, structured errors, session hooks, agent skills, content-first no-args, and contextual disclosure. Ensure 90%+ test coverage.

## Sub-Tasks

- [ ] Create integration test suite for mode selection
- [ ] Create integration test suite for TOON format
- [ ] Create integration test suite for minimal schemas
- [ ] Create integration test suite for content truncation
- [ ] Create integration test suite for pre-computed aggregates
- [ ] Create integration test suite for empty states
- [ ] Create integration test suite for structured errors
- [ ] Create integration test suite for session hooks
- [ ] Create integration test suite for agent skills
- [ ] Create integration test suite for content-first no-args
- [ ] Create integration test suite for contextual disclosure
- [ ] Add end-to-end agent mode workflow tests
- [ ] Add cross-platform integration tests
- [ ] Measure and document test coverage
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for agent mode features
- [ ] Add CI integration test execution

Status conventions: mark in-progress with `[~]`, done with `[x]`, blocked with `[!]`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All agent mode features have integration tests
- [ ] Test coverage is 90%+ for agent mode code
- [ ] Integration tests pass consistently
- [ ] End-to-end agent workflows are tested
- [ ] Cross-platform tests work on Linux, macOS, Windows
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are established
- [ ] CI runs integration tests automatically

## Test Plan

- Integration: `cargo test --test integration`
- Coverage: `cargo test -- --nocapture`
- Performance: Run benchmarks for agent mode features
- Cross-platform: Test on Linux, macOS, Windows

## Observability

- Track test coverage metrics
- Monitor integration test pass rates
- Log performance benchmark results

## Compliance

- Ensure all AXI requirements are tested
- Follow testing best practices

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Flaky integration tests — Mitigation: Use deterministic test data and proper cleanup
- Risk: Long test execution time — Mitigation: Parallelize tests where possible

## Dependencies

- All previous stories (01-001 through 05-002) — Integration tests require all features

## Notes

- Integration testing is critical for agent mode reliability
- Focus on real-world agent usage patterns
