## Summary

Implement idempotent mutations, structured errors on stdout, no interactive prompts, and proper output channels. Ensure errors go to stdout in structured format with actionable suggestions. Reserve non-zero exit codes for situations where agent intent cannot be satisfied.

## Sub-Tasks

- [ ] Implement idempotent mutation logic (no error when state already exists)
- [ ] Add structured error formatting on stdout
- [ ] Include actionable suggestions in error messages
- [ ] Validate required flags before calling dependencies
- [ ] Translate errors to extract actionable meaning
- [ ] Never leak dependency names in error messages
- [ ] Suppress interactive prompts in agent mode
- [ ] Ensure every operation is completable with flags alone
- [ ] Implement proper output channels (stdout: data/errors, stderr: logs)
- [ ] Add structured error tests
- [ ] Update exit code logic (0: success/no-op, 1: error, 2: usage)

Status conventions: mark in-progress with `[~]`, done with `[x]`, blocked with `[!]`.

## Relevant Files

- `src/error.rs` — Structured error types and formatting
- `src/main.rs` — Exit code logic and output channel separation
- `src/cli.rs` — Flag validation and prompt suppression
- `tests/error_test.rs` (new) — Structured error tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Idempotent operations don't error when state already exists
- [ ] Errors go to stdout in structured format
- [ ] Error messages include actionable suggestions
- [ ] Required flags are validated before dependency calls
- [ ] Dependency names are never leaked in errors
- [ ] Interactive prompts are suppressed in agent mode
- [ ] All operations are completable with flags alone
- [ ] Exit codes follow standard (0: success, 1: error, 2: usage)
- [ ] Output channels are properly separated

## Test Plan

- Unit: `cargo test error`
- Integration: Test error scenarios for all commands
- Lint: `cargo clippy`
- Types: `cargo check`

## Observability

- Log error occurrences and types
- Track exit code distribution

## Compliance

- Follow AXI structured error requirements
- Ensure backward compatibility with human mode prompts

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Breaking existing error handling — Mitigation: Maintain error message clarity while adding structure
- Risk: Complex error translation logic — Mitigation: Keep translation simple and well-documented

## Dependencies

- 01-001 (Mode Selection) — Agent mode detection for prompt suppression
- 01-002 (TOON Format) — Structured errors in TOON format

## Notes

- Structured errors are critical for agent understanding
- Idempotency reduces agent retry complexity
