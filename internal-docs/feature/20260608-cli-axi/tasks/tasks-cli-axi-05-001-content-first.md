## Summary

Implement content-first no-args behavior that shows most relevant live state instead of usage manual. Redesign no-args invocation to show state summary. Move detailed help to --help flag. Show different content based on current directory/context.

## Sub-Tasks

- [ ] Redesign no-args invocation to show state summary
- [ ] Implement directory/context-aware content display
- [ ] Show operations summary when in git repository
- [ ] Show daemon status when daemon is running
- [ ] Include contextual help suggestions in no-args output
- [ ] Move detailed help to --help flag (unchanged)
- [ ] Apply content-first to both agent and human modes
- [ ] Add no-args tests for different contexts
- [ ] Update CLI help text to document no-args behavior
- [ ] Ensure no-args output is TOON-formatted in agent mode

Status conventions: mark in-progress with `[~]`, done with `[x]`, blocked with `[!]`.

## Relevant Files

- `src/main.rs` — No-args behavior logic
- `src/cli.rs` — Context detection and content display
- `tests/noargs_test.rs` (new) — No-args tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No-args shows live state, not usage manual
- [ ] Content is context-aware (directory, daemon status)
- [ ] Operations summary shown in git repository
- [ ] Daemon status shown when running
- [ ] Contextual help suggestions included
- [ ] --help flag shows detailed help
- [ ] Works in both agent and human modes
- [ ] Agent mode uses TOON format

## Test Plan

- Unit: `cargo test noargs`
- Integration: Test no-args in different contexts
- Lint: `cargo clippy`
- Types: `cargo check`

## Observability

- Log no-args invocations and context
- Track context detection accuracy

## Compliance

- Follow AXI content-first requirements
- Ensure backward compatibility with --help

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Breaking existing user expectations — Mitigation: Keep --help unchanged and document new behavior
- Risk: Context detection complexity — Mitigation: Keep context logic simple and well-documented

## Dependencies

- 01-003 (Minimal Default Schemas) — No-args uses minimal schemas
- 02-002 (Pre-computed Aggregates) — No-args shows aggregate summaries

## Notes

- Content-first reduces agent API calls
- Context awareness makes output more relevant
