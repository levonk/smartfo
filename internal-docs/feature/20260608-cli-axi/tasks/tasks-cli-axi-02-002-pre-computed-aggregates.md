## Summary

Implement pre-computed aggregate counts and derived status fields in list outputs. Include total counts (not just page size) and lightweight summaries (operations completed, queue pending). Compute counts efficiently at query time.

## Sub-Tasks

- [x] Implement aggregate count computation for list queries
- [x] Add total count to list output format (count: X of Y total)
- [x] Implement derived status fields (operations: 3/3 completed, queue: 7 pending)
- [x] Optimize count queries for efficiency
- [x] Add derived fields to detail views where relevant
- [x] Update list command to include operation count aggregates
- [x] Update status command to include queue and daemon aggregates
- [x] Add aggregate computation tests
- [x] Ensure aggregates work with both TOON and JSON
- [~] Update CLI help text to document aggregate fields

Status conventions: mark in-progress with `[~]`, done with `[x]`, blocked with `[!]`.

## Relevant Files

- `src/output/aggregates.rs` (new) — Aggregate computation logic
- `src/output/mod.rs` — Add aggregate module exports
- `src/output/schema.rs` — Add aggregate fields to schemas
- `src/main.rs` — Add aggregate integration to list/status commands
- `tests/aggregates_test.rs` (new) — Aggregate tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] List outputs show total counts (count: X of Y total)
- [x] Derived status fields are included inline
- [x] Aggregate computation is efficient
- [x] Aggregates work with both TOON and JSON
- [x] List command shows operation count
- [x] Status command shows queue and daemon aggregates
- [x] Aggregates are computed at query time

## Test Plan

- Unit: `cargo test output::aggregates`
- Integration: Test aggregates for all list commands
- Performance: Benchmark aggregate computation
- Lint: `cargo clippy`
- Types: `cargo check`

## Observability

- Log aggregate computation performance
- Track aggregate field usage

## Compliance

- Follow AXI pre-computed aggregate requirements
- Ensure aggregates don't significantly impact performance

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Performance impact from aggregate computation — Mitigation: Optimize queries and cache where appropriate
- Risk: Complex aggregate logic — Mitigation: Keep aggregates simple and well-documented

## Dependencies

- 01-003 (Minimal Default Schemas) — Schemas define which aggregates to include

## Notes

- Aggregates reduce need for follow-up API calls
- Keep aggregates lightweight and cheap to compute
