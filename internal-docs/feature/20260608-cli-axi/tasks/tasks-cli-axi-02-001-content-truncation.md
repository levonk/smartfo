## Summary

Implement content truncation for large text fields (500-1500 chars default). Add --full flag to disable truncation. Include truncation metadata and help suggestions. Apply to both agent and human modes for consistent behavior.

## Sub-Tasks

- [ ] Implement truncation logic with configurable limit (default 1000 chars)
- [ ] Add --full CLI flag to disable truncation
- [ ] Include truncation metadata in output (total size, truncated indicator)
- [ ] Add help suggestions for --full flag when content is truncated
- [ ] Apply truncation to file paths, VCS messages, error details
- [ ] Add truncation tests for various field types
- [ ] Update CLI help text to document truncation behavior
- [ ] Add config option for default truncation limit
- [ ] Test truncation with different content sizes
- [ ] Ensure truncation works in both agent and human modes

Status conventions: mark in-progress with `[~]`, done with `[x]`, blocked with `[!]`.

## Relevant Files

- `src/output/truncation.rs` (new) — Truncation logic
- `src/output/mod.rs` — Integrate truncation into output pipeline
- `src/config.rs` — Add truncation limit config option
- `tests/truncation_test.rs` (new) — Truncation tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Large text fields are truncated by default (1000 chars)
- [ ] --full flag disables truncation
- [ ] Truncation metadata shows total size
- [ ] Help suggestions appear when content is truncated
- [ ] Truncation applies to all large text fields
- [ ] Config option sets default truncation limit
- [ ] Truncation works in both agent and human modes

## Test Plan

- Unit: `cargo test output::truncation`
- Integration: Test truncation with various content sizes
- Lint: `cargo clippy`
- Types: `cargo check`

## Observability

- Log truncation decisions
- Track --full flag usage

## Compliance

- Follow AXI truncation requirements
- Ensure backward compatibility with --full flag

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Truncation hides important information — Mitigation: Always show truncated preview with metadata
- Risk: Config complexity — Mitigation: Keep config simple with sensible defaults

## Dependencies

- 01-003 (Minimal Default Schemas) — Schemas define which fields to truncate

## Notes

- Truncation is critical for token efficiency
- Balance between preview and completeness
