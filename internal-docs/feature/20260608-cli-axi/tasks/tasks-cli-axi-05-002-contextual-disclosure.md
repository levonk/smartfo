## Summary

Implement contextual disclosure with next step suggestions. Include 2-4 relevant suggestions ranked by relevance. Make suggestions actionable (complete commands with flags). Format as structured help[] array in TOON output. Enable organic CLI surface area discovery.

## Sub-Tasks

- [ ] Implement suggestion engine for each command
- [ ] Generate contextual help based on current state and output
- [ ] Format suggestions as structured help[] array in TOON
- [ ] Include suggestions in all command outputs
- [ ] Make suggestions context-aware (not generic)
- [ ] Limit to 2-4 suggestions maximum
- [ ] Rank suggestions by relevance
- [ ] Ensure suggestions are complete commands with flags
- [ ] Add suggestion tests for various contexts
- [ ] Update CLI help text to document suggestion behavior

Status conventions: mark in-progress with `[~]`, done with `[x]`, blocked with `[!]`.

## Relevant Files

- `src/output/suggestions.rs` (new) — Suggestion engine
- `src/cli/list.rs` — List-specific suggestions
- `src/cli/status.rs` — Status-specific suggestions
- `tests/suggestions_test.rs` (new) — Suggestion tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Suggestions are included in all command outputs
- [ ] Suggestions are formatted as help[] array in TOON
- [ ] Suggestions are context-aware and relevant
- [ ] Suggestions are complete commands with flags
- [ ] 2-4 suggestions maximum per output
- [ ] Suggestions are ranked by relevance
- [ ] Suggestions enable organic CLI discovery

## Test Plan

- Unit: `cargo test suggestions`
- Integration: Test suggestions for all commands and contexts
- Lint: `cargo clippy`
- Types: `cargo check`

## Observability

- Log suggestion generation events
- Track suggestion relevance and usage

## Compliance

- Follow AXI contextual disclosure requirements
- Ensure suggestions are helpful, not overwhelming

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Irrelevant suggestions — Mitigation: Use context-aware ranking and limit to 2-4
- Risk: Complex suggestion logic — Mitigation: Keep suggestion rules simple and well-documented

## Dependencies

- 01-003 (Minimal Default Schemas) — Suggestions reference schema fields
- 02-002 (Pre-computed Aggregates) — Suggestions use aggregate data

## Notes

- Contextual disclosure enables organic CLI discovery
- Suggestions should be smart, not generic
