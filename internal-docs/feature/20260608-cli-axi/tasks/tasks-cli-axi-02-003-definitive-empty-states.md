## Summary

Implement definitive empty states that explicitly state when a query has no results. Include context (filter criteria, scope) and ensure exit code 0 for successful empty queries. Format empty states consistently across all commands.

## Sub-Tasks

- [x] Detect empty result sets across all commands (list, status, queue)
- [x] Format empty states with explicit "0 results" message
- [x] Include context in empty state messages (filter criteria, scope)
- [x] Ensure exit code 0 for successful empty queries
- [x] Apply consistent empty state formatting across commands
- [x] Add empty state tests for all commands
- [x] Update list command empty state format
- [x] Update status command empty state format
- [~] Update CLI help text to document empty state behavior

Status conventions: mark in-progress with `[~]`, done with `[x]`, blocked with `[!]`.

## Relevant Files

- `src/output/empty.rs` (new) — Empty state formatting logic
- `src/main.rs` — Apply empty state formatting to list and status commands
- `src/cli.rs` — Update help text for list and status commands
- `tests/empty_test.rs` (new) — Empty state tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Empty states explicitly state "0 results"
- [x] Empty states include context (filter criteria, scope)
- [x] Exit code 0 for successful empty queries
- [x] Empty state formatting is consistent
- [x] All commands have proper empty states
- [x] Empty states work with both TOON and JSON

## Test Plan

- Unit: `cargo test output::empty`
- Integration: Test empty states for all commands
- Lint: `cargo clippy`
- Types: `cargo check`

## Observability

- Log empty query results
- Track empty state patterns

## Compliance

- Follow AXI definitive empty state requirements
- Ensure agents can distinguish empty results from errors

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Confusion between empty results and errors — Mitigation: Use clear formatting and exit codes
- Risk: Inconsistent empty state messages — Mitigation: Use centralized formatting logic

## Dependencies

- 01-003 (Minimal Default Schemas) — Schemas define empty state structure

## Notes

- Empty states are critical for agent understanding
- Clear distinction between "no results" and "error"
