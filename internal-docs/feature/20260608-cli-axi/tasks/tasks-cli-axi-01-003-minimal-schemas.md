## Summary

Implement minimal default schemas (3-4 fields) for command outputs to reduce token consumption. Add --fields flag for explicit field selection. Move long-form content to detail views. Apply schemas to both TOON and JSON output formats.

## Sub-Tasks

- [ ] Define default output schemas for each command (list, status, install, etc.)
- [ ] Implement field selection logic with --fields flag
- [ ] Add field validation against available fields
- [ ] Update list command to use minimal schema (id, type, status, source)
- [ ] Update status command to use minimal schema (operations, queue, daemon)
- [ ] Move long-form content (file paths, VCS messages) to detail views
- [ ] Apply schema logic to both TOON and JSON outputs
- [ ] Add field selection tests
- [ ] Update CLI help text to document --fields flag

Status conventions: mark in-progress with `[~]`, done with `[x]`, blocked with `[!]`.

## Relevant Files

- `src/output/schema.rs` (new) — Schema definition and field selection
- `src/cli/list.rs` — Apply minimal schema to list command
- `src/cli/status.rs` — Apply minimal schema to status command
- `tests/schema_test.rs` (new) — Schema and field selection tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Default schemas have 3-4 fields maximum
- [ ] --fields flag allows explicit field selection
- [ ] Field names are validated against available fields
- [ ] Long-form content is in detail views only
- [ ] Schemas apply to both TOON and JSON
- [ ] All commands use minimal schemas by default
- [ ] Field selection works correctly

## Test Plan

- Unit: `cargo test output::schema`
- Integration: Test field selection for all commands
- Lint: `cargo clippy`
- Types: `cargo check`

## Observability

- Log field selection requests
- Track schema usage patterns

## Compliance

- Follow AXI minimal schema requirements
- Ensure backward compatibility with full output via --fields

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Breaking existing scripts expecting full output — Mitigation: Maintain backward compatibility with --fields flag
- Risk: Schema complexity — Mitigation: Keep schema logic simple and well-documented

## Dependencies

- None

## Notes

- Minimal schemas are critical for agent mode token efficiency
- Balance between minimal output and usability
